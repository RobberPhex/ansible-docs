`````````````````

.. toctree:: :maxdepth: 1

  add_host - add a host (and alternatively a group) to the ansible-playbook in-memory inventory <add_host_module>
  group_by - Create Ansible groups based on facts <group_by_module>



.. note::
    -  (D): This marks a module as deprecated, which means a module is kept for backwards compatibility but usage is discouraged.  The module documentation details page may explain more about this rationale.
    -  (E): This marks a module as 'extras', which means it ships with ansible but may be a newer module and possibly (but not necessarily) less actively maintained than 'core' modules.
    - Tickets filed on modules are filed to different repos than those on the main open source project. Core module tickets should be filed at `ansible/ansible-modules-core on GitHub <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core>`_, extras tickets to `ansible/ansible-modules-extras on GitHub <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras>`_
