If <code>absent</code>, directories will be recursively deleted, and files will be removed. If <code>touch</code>, an empty file will be created if the c(path) does not exist, while an existing file or directory will receive updated file access and modification times (similar to the way `touch` works from the command line).</td>

    # remove a file, if present
    - win_file: path=C:\temp\foo.conf state=absent

This is a Core Module
---------------------

This source of this module is hosted on GitHub in the `ansible-modules-core <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core>`_ repo.
  
If you believe you have found a bug in this module, and are already running the latest stable or development version of Ansible, first look in the `issue tracker at github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core <http://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-core>`_ to see if a bug has already been filed.  If not, we would be grateful if you would file one.

Should you have a question rather than a bug report, inquries are welcome on the `ansible-project google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-project>`_ or on Ansible's "#ansible" channel, located on irc.freenode.net.   Development oriented topics should instead use the similar `ansible-devel google group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ansible-devel>`_.

Documentation updates for this module can also be edited directly by submitting a pull request to the module source code, just look for the "DOCUMENTATION" block in the source tree.

This is a "core" ansible module, which means it will receive slightly higher priority for all requests than those in the "extras" repos.
